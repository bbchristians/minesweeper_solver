# Why
I've been stuck trying to beat a 12x20 minesweeper field that contains 95 bombs for some time now. So, I decided to make an attempt
at determining what the actual odds of beating a game are.

Current implementation says that the odds of beating that configuration is between approximately 1e-4% and 1e-8%, 
however there is still some room for improvement in my solving algorithm.
